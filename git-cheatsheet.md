# GIT and GITHUB

## First Steps and commands:

1. In terminal, navigate to the folder that you want git to pay attention to:
    - cd file path
2. Initialize your repository which tells Git to pay attention to the repository (folder)


### When you are adding a new document to an existing folder in github:
- in this case you do not need to initialize
- commands:

    git add\
    git commit -m "insert what you are editing"\
    git push origin master
